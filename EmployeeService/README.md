# PMO Pipeline Project - Employee Service
This repository contains the code for the employee service; A microservice to be used within the PMO Pipeline Project

This was created as an exercise for me to learn more about Spring AMQP in detail. And as such is not meant to be treated as "production ready"

## Project details

The employee micro-service requires connection to both a RabbitMQ broker and MySQL instance to start correctly.
As can be seen in [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) the details of these services can be configured
and I've added some defaults to fall back on.

##Requirements
Need more details

##API
Need more details

##Docker
A simple Dockerfile for this project can be found [here](Dockerfile)
