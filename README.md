# PMO Pipeline Project
This repository contains the code for the PMO Pipeline Project

This was created as an exercise for me to some more practical experience with:
- Spring AMQP
- Designing and development of a micro-service architecture
- Creating a pipeline in AWS code-pipeline which can commission resources with which to run integration tests

As this is an exercise the project is not meant to be treated as "production ready"
